# MINI-LEARNING PLATFORM

This project is the week 3 hands-on project for  the TSI Bootcamp. The aim of the project is to ensure that learning are able to apply backend principles like authentication, authorization and the use of customized middleware to api routes.

### INTRODUCTION

The mini-learning platform is a backend project that have different classes of users and allows all users to view courses available on the platform. The courses are created by the class of users known as the instructors. An instructor can create courses, updated and delete the courses he/she created. An admin has access to all courses and can update or delete a course. The platform also allowed registered users (students) to enroll for courses on the platform.

Each courses have one or more lessons which are created by the course instructor. Only students that are enrolled for a course can view the lessons attached to  the course.

### FEATURES

* **USER AUTHENTICATION**: Secure user authentication with JWT to ensure that authorized usrs can access specific endpoints.
* **CRUD OPERATIONS**: Support for Create, Read, Update, and Delete operations for resources, allowing you to manage data easily and efficiently.
* **COMPREHENSIVE DOCUMENTATION:** Fully documented API endpoints with examples, making it easy for developers to understand how to interact with the API.
* **ERROR HANDLING**: Robust error handling to provide clear feedback and status codes for various failure modes, enhancing the developer experience.

### TECHNOLOGY USED

1. **JWT (Json Web Token)**, it is used for user authentication and authorization.
2. **Argon2**, this is used for hashing the users password before saving to the database.
3. **MongoDb,** this is the database based used for storing the data.
4. **Express**, this is a nodejs based framework that helps to simplifies the development of server-side applications by offering an easy-to-use API for routing, middleware, and HTTP utilities.
5. **Nodejs**, the server environment.
